# Portfolio

Thank you for checking out my portfolio.

I am a recent graduate of a full stack JavaScript web development boot camp and am pursuing my goal of being the best web developer ever. I find a resonance with creating the point of interaction with consumers, whether internal or external. Making an interface that is easy and useful is what I strive for.

In my free time, I enjoy nature photography, music (both listening to and attending concerts), video games, movies, and cooking.

Please feel free to contact me for any opportunites or questions.
